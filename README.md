## Supervised-Image-Classification-with-SUV
In this example, I used Support Vector Machine(SUV) algorithm to classify images of cheetah, lion and tiger.
The dataset used in this example was downloaded with bing download and each folder has 50 pictures.
The accuracy in this example is very low but this was just to get hands on experience with supervived image classification
